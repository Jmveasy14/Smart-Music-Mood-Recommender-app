## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Local Installation

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* A Spotify Developer account
* A Google AI Studio account

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Vibecast.git](https://github.com/your-username/Vibecast.git)
cd Vibecast
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

This project requires API keys to connect to Spotify and Google.

1.  Navigate into the `server` directory: `cd server`
2.  Create a new file named `.env`.
3.  Add the following variables to the `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual keys:

    ```env
    # Spotify API Credentials
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
    SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=[http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/auth/callback](http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/auth/callback)
    
    # Google Gemini API Key
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
    
    # Frontend URI for local development
    FRONTEND_URI=[http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)
    ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

You will need to install dependencies for both the backend and frontend separately.

* **For the backend:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

* **For the frontend:**

    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

### 4. Run the Application

You will need two separate terminal windows to run the application.

* **In your first terminal, start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the /server directory
    node server.js
    ```
    *Your server should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8888`.*

* **In your second terminal, start the frontend client:**

    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the /client directory
    npm start
    ```
    *This will automatically open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:3000` where the app will be running.*
